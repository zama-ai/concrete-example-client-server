# Concrete Client/Server example

This concrete example demonstrates the use of:

* Building Client Server architecture
* Communicating via TcpStream
* Using serialization to exchange encrypted data
* Using serialization to save a client key locally and save processing time
* Creating a generic function for use with different Fhe types
* Simple multithreading on the server side to handle multiple clients at the same time
